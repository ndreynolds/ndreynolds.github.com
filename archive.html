<p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/blog/learning-rust-via-advent-of-code/">this post</a> from Forest Smith on his experience learning Rust with Advent of Code, I wanted to share my own experience working through the problems this past December to improve my Haskell skills.</p>

<p>Elixir may seem like an odd choice for building terminal applications. In fact, when I started this project, that’s exactly what I thought.</p>
<p>Before I get into that, I’ll first give you some background as to why I even would try something like that, then I promise to get back to building terminal apps.</p>

  <h4>February 10, 2015</h4>
  
    <p>I recently decided to give the <a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust programming language</a> a try. Although Rust had crossed my radar a few times before, I’d never gotten much further than <em>Hello World!</em>. The language has undergone a lot of change over the last few years, but things appear to finally be slowing down for its upcoming 1.0 release.</p>

  </h3>
  <h4>January 31, 2015</h4>
  
    <p>In this post, I want to explore a few of the ways to exchange data between a Rails app and an AngularJS module—looking at the pros and cons of each approach. While Angular sees a lot of usage in single-page applications (SPAs), I’ve found it just as useful for enhancing certain pages of a Rails application with more dynamic interfaces, while sticking to plain, scaffoldable CRUD screens for the rest of the app.</p>

  </h3>
  <h4>January 20, 2015</h4>
  
    <p>In this two-part series, I cover testing a Rails application using RSpec and some other popular gems. If you missed Part 1, you can catch up here.</p>

  </h3>
  <h4>July 15, 2014</h4>
  
    <p>In this two-part series, I’ll cover testing a Rails application—from how to get set up with the latest toolchain, to writing those first tests.</p>
